# ShopDog

ShopDog is the 2nd place submission for NeoDeveloper League 2024. It is a comprehensive system for cashierless stores, using RFID to scan the items in a cart, and using Stripe to handle payment. It also tracks stock, saving small store owners hours of labour costs that come with manually counting stock. The project, created in 10 hours, makes these technologies used by big warehouses, and multi-million dollar companies, more accessible to small businesses, leveling out the playing field, and helping the underdogs.
